# Eye_Disease_Detection_System
A machine learning project aimed at detecting common eye diseases, including glaucoma, diabetic retinopathy, and cataract, using image processing and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The system leverages medical imaging to help in the early diagnosis of these diseases. Built with Python, TensorFlow, and OpenCV.
